# Stellar.js - Rails Plugin

Add parallex effects to your website easier than ever. [Stellar.js](https://github.com/markdalgleish/stellar.js) by[Mark Dalgeish](https://github.com/markdalgleish) makes it possible for just about any one to makcreate parallex effects with the use of data-attributes.

It precisely aligns elements and backgrounds. All elements and backgrounds will return to their original position when they meet the edge of the screenâ€”plus or minus your own optional offset.

This is a wrapper to easily include the latest stable **Stellar.js** library to your Rails application.


## Installation

Add the following to your Gemfile and run `bundle install`.


    //= require jquery
    //= require jquery.stellar


## Getting Started

Stellar.js is a jQuery plugin that provides parallax scrolling effects to any scrolling element. The first step is to run .stellar() against the element:


    // For example:
    $(window).stellar();
    // or:
    $('#main').stellar();

If you're running Stellar.js on 'window', you can use the shorthand:

    $.stellar();
